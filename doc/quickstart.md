## Quick Start

after installing TUtils, you can quickly get started by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
tutils --help
```

This will run `getFileCount.py` in `~/.tutils/Scripts/`, and show the result in terminal.

you should add `:` before it if you want use arguments to run script.

```bash
tutils run getFileCount :show
```
