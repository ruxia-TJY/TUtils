# TUtils

Most of my work involves using the command line, and sometimes it's simply faster than launching new software. I love Python because countless talented developers have created powerful packages that let me accomplish all sorts of tasks through it. I want to build a command-line tool that lets me achieve what I need without worrying about the underlying code. And I'm still developing it.    

See [doc](./docs/index.md) for more details.

## How to Use 

  You can install TUtils using pip:
  
  ```
  pip install tutils        # No,Not yet submitted to PyPI,Please install it from source code.
  ```

  After installation, you can use the `tutils` command followed by the desired subcommand to perform various tasks. For example:
  
  ```
  tutils subcommand [options]
  ```

  For detailed usage instructions and available subcommands, please refer to the documentation or run:
  
  ```
  tutils --help
  ```
